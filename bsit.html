            <h2>Why did I choose BSIT?</h2>
            <p>I chose this course mainly because of the growing demand of people who are literate in computers, but also because of my love for computers.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was young, my spark for the love of computers only grew stronger, which is why I feel like right now, this is the best course for me.</p>

            <p>Choosing BSIT wasnâ€™t just about securing a stable career; it was about following a passion that resonates deeply with my interests and aspirations. I look forward to learning, growing, and contributing to the dynamic world of Information Technology.</p>
